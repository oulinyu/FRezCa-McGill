History of FRezCa
=================

The FRezCa (First-year Residence Cafeteria) tutorial program was established in 2014 to address typical “large classroom” issues faced by incoming STEM students. FRezCa aims to be a “learning community” by creating a supportive environment that can help address the challenges faced by incoming university students, including the often isolating experience of large, auditorium-style lecture classes. In freshman-level Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, and Biology, professors are tasked with conveying a broad base of subject material within a relatively short period of time to students with diverse disciplinary interests and varying levels of preparation.

At FRezCa, various TAs and TEAM (Tomlinson Engagement Award for Mentoring) award recipients are present to answer questions and guide new university students in their freshman science courses. FRezCa aims to facilitate discussion between students and encourages teamwork and discussion based learning. TEAM mentors and TAs are present to direct students towards the right answers and improve understanding of scientific contents covered in class. The mix between students who have successfully completed these courses in their university careers (TEAM mentors) with experienced TAs studying more advanced materials allows for a collaborative environment with various levels of expertise.
