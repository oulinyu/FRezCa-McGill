What is FRezCa?
---------------

FRezCa (Freshman Residence Cafeteria) tutorials is a space for U0/U1 students in large science classes to:
- Work together
- Study in shared space
- Learn from each other
- Complete homework or assignments collaboratively
- Ask for help from other students, undergraduate TEAM mentors or graduate TAs

FRezCa was previously held in the Royal Victoria College residence cafeteria but this semester (Fall 2020) will be a fully online virtual platform held on MS Teams! All students enrolled in BIOL 111, BIOL 200, CHEM 110, CHEM 212, CHEM 222, MATH 133, MATH 140, MATH 141, PHYS 101 and PHYS 131 are welcome to participate.

History of FRezCa
-----------------

The FRezCa (First-year Residence Cafeteria) tutorial program was established in 2014 to address typical “large classroom” issues faced by incoming STEM students. FRezCa aims to be a “learning community” by creating a supportive environment that can help address the challenges faced by incoming university students, including the often isolating experience of large, auditorium-style lecture classes. In freshman-level Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, and Biology, professors are tasked with conveying a broad base of subject material within a relatively short period of time to students with diverse disciplinary interests and varying levels of preparation.

At FRezCa, various TAs and TEAM (Tomlinson Engagement Award for Mentoring) award recipients are present to answer questions and guide new university students in their freshman science courses. FRezCa aims to facilitate discussion between students and encourages teamwork and discussion based learning. TEAM mentors and TAs are present to direct students towards the right answers and improve understanding of scientific contents covered in class. The mix between students who have successfully completed these courses in their university careers (TEAM mentors) with experienced TAs studying more advanced materials allows for a collaborative environment with various levels of expertise.
