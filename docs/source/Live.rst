Description
-----------

The Live FRezCa space has been configured to ensure appropriate physical distancing. All of McGill’s safety protocols are in operation, including enhanced cleaning, mandatory use of procedural masks, and clear signage.

There is no assigned seating. Once you occupy a work station, please remain at that station for the duration of your time in the Live FRezCa space.

There is a very limited number of power outlets in the Live FRezCa space, with only very few work stations having access to an outlet. We recommend that students using the space leave home or campus with a fully charged device. There is no access to charging stations for cellphones or laptops, and there are no chargers available for loan.

The space will be professionally cleaned and disinfected between time slots. Cleaning materials will also be available on site, should students wish to wipe down a work station prior to use. A full cleaning and disinfection will be carried out at the end of each day.

Once inside, take the escalator to the first floor and follow the signs to Room 109.

A service agent will ask for your booking confirmation and ensure you have met the government guidelines for access to the campus.

You may then choose any available work station within the space.

Please follow all directional and physical distancing signage.

Please do not move the furniture, it has been organized to respect physical distancing.

You may arrive at any time during your booking. Please ensure you leave on time so we have ample time to clean the space for the next students. You may leave before your booking is over. Please exit without lingering or talking with other students to ensure distance protocols are maintained.

Should you experience any health issues while on site, please advise the service agent immediately, they will direct you to the isolation room. Security will be contacted immediately to help ensure that all safety protocols are followed.

..
     **What:** A space with socially-distanced tables to work independently, or chat quietly with other students and staff present at a distance of at least 2m apart. Academic support (by teaching staff, TAs, or TEAM) will not be provided in-person at Live FRezCa – however, students are encouraged to access the MS Teams Virtual FRezCa platform while in the Live FRezCa space!
     Note: Although the times for Live FRezCa may not necessarily overlap with scheduled course FRezCa sessions, the Virtual Café channels remain open for students at all times.
     **Why:** While we know that not all students are currently based in Montreal, we recognize that some may want or need an on-campus space for quiet studying with big tables, natural light, and a good internet connection. This location was selected for all of the above and will exclusively be open to early-year students enrolled in courses using FRezCa. You can work independently, or feel free to discuss the undergraduate experience together, ask general questions about your faculty or department, or just come to chat with a real person face-to-face!
