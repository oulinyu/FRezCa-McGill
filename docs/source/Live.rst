Live FRezCa
===========

As FRezCa is a **collaborative**, **diverse**, and **inclusive** learning community, we aim to foster a welcoming environment that is accessible to all students. To ensure a successful experience for everybody, participants in this program are expected to follow these basic rules, procedures, and expectations:

1. Be **respectful** of others regardless of their race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, belief, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, or any other status. Discrimination or harassment of any form will not be **tolerated**, and disruptive students may be asked to leave.
2. All FRezCa participants are expected to display collegial, civil, and respectful behaviour at all times and towards all other participants. If you feel uncomfortable at any time due to the behaviour of others, contact FRezCa admin staff immediately.
3. The role of TEAM mentors, TAs, and professors is to guide the learning process but not necessarily to provide direct solutions to course problems.
4. TEAM mentors and TAs should attempt to manage their time to be fair to all students. This may include encouraging discussions amongst small groups of students. Please be respectful of other students' needs and try not to monopolize mentors and TAs.

The FRezCa Teams will be moderated by the TEAM mentors, Teaching Assistants, Professors, and FRezCa admin to ensure a safe learning environment for all students. If any problems or concerns arise, please contact the FRezCa admin immediately.
